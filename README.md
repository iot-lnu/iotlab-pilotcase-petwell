# What has been done
## Software setup
All the **ESP32** have been flashed using the **BME688 Development Kit**. Afterwards, we can create the custom config file using the **BME AI-Studio Destktop**. All of those softwares are available on [Bosch official website](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/software-tools/software/bme688-software/).

## Hardware setup
All the sensors have been configured with this [config file](2024_08_02_08_53_BoardConfiguration.bmeconfig). Then everything was assembled so the experiment looks like that.
